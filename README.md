# ragnasong_downloader

Python script to download custom songs from ragnasongs for Ragnarock (Steam).

# Usage

Install latest python (at least 3.6).
Edit the `config.json` to your likings.
- `min_votes`: songs with less than this number of votes will be ignored
- `good_bad_ratio`: songs with a rating ratio lower than that will be ignored (this ratio is the percentage of good ratings)
- `ignored_songs`: list of songs that you don't want, even if it fits the criteria above.
- `verbose`: if true, show more logs

From the command line, go to the directory of this script and run `python .`
